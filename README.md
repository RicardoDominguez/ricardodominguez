I'm a master's student in Machine Learning at the
[University of Tübingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/faculties/faculty-of-science/departments/computer-science/research/#c780447).
I'm fortunate to work with
[Bernhard Schölkopf](https://is.mpg.de/~bs) and
[Amir-Hossein Karimi](https://sites.google.com/view/amirhkarimi)
at the [Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems](https://is.mpg.de/).
My research interests broadly lie in the area of trustworthy machine learning, particularly in relation to model explainability and robustness.
Lately, I have been focusing on algorithmic recourse.
